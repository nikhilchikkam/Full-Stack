# Speed Typing Test

This is a simple web application that tests how fast you can type a randomly generated quote. The app displays a quote, starts a timer, and tracks how long it takes for the user to type the quote correctly. 

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: Implements the core functionality using:
  - **Fetch API**: To fetch random quotes.
  - **setInterval**: To update the timer every second.
  - **clearInterval**: To stop the timer once the user submits the correct input.
  - **EventListeners**: For handling user actions like submitting the typed text and resetting the game.
- **HTML**: The structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: Styling for the layout and elements, with custom styles and Bootstrap classes.
