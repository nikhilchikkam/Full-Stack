# Library Management System

This is a simple web-based **Library Management System** that allows users to search for books by title and displays the search results dynamically. The project utilizes **Bootstrap 4**, **JavaScript**, and an external API to fetch book details.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Fetching data from an external API and manipulating the DOM dynamically.
- **API**: External book API (https://apis.ccbp.in/book-store) to fetch book details.
- **HTML5**: Structuring the web page.
- **CSS3 (Bootstrap 4)**: Styling and layout, with responsive design using Bootstrapâ€™s grid system.


## Features

- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for books by typing the title into the search bar.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes (smartphones, tablets, and desktops).
- **Dynamic Book Results**: The search results are dynamically fetched from an external API and displayed as book cards with images, titles, and authors.
- **Loading Indicator**: A spinner is shown while book results are being fetched.
- **Error Handling**: Displays a "No results found" message when no books match the search query.
